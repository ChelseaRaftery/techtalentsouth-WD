      <h2> Growing up with Chelsea</h2>
      <p>  Chelsea loved growing up in a small town. Her mom, dad and younger sister Sarah are extremely close. Chelsea was an avid sports enthusiast
        and loved spending time on the soccer field and basketball court. After graduating from highschool, Chelsea enrolled at the University of Connecticut.
        It had been a dream of hers to join the Husky family. She graduated in 2009 with a degree in Communications, and set her sight on Boston, MA.

      <h3> BOSTON, MA </h3>
      <p> Chelsea moved to Boston, MA in the Summer of 2010. With $500 and not a clue - she embarked on what would be her first taste of adult hood.</p>

    <ul>
        <li> First she rented an apartment with 4 of her closest friends</li>
        <li> Next, she got her first big kid gig as an executive assistant at Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial realty firm. She then
          went on to work in campaign management for PayPal Media Network. </li>
        <li> While working and living in Boston's North end, Chelsea got her fill of pastries and pasta and loved getting to know the city</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>North Carolina Bound</h4>
      <p> Chelsea moved to North Carolina to pursue an opportunity with a boutique fitness company that was opening their first Raleigh Studio.
        She is passionate about health and wellness, and was excited to get Flywheel Sports up and running. Her family had also moved to NC, so it was
        great to be close to them again.</p>
