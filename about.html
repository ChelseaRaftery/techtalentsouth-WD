      <h2> BOSTON, MA </h2>

      <p> Chelsea moved to Boston, MA in the Summer of 2010. With $500 and not a clue - she embarked on what would be her first taste of adult hood.</p>

    <ul>
        <li> First she rented an apartment with 4 of her closest friends</li>
        <li> Next, she got her first big kid gig as an executive assistant at Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial realty firm. She then
          went on to work in campaign management for PayPal Media Network. </li>
        <li> While working and living in Boston's North End, Chelsea got her fill of pastries and pasta and loved getting to know the city</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>North Carolina Bound</h2>
      <p> Chelsea moved to North Carolina to pursue an opportunity with a boutique fitness company that was opening their first Raleigh Studio.
        She is passionate about health and wellness, and was excited to get Flywheel Sports up and running. Her family had also moved to NC, so it was
        great to be close to them again.</p>

      <ul>
          <li> Her job with Flywheel took her to Miami, FL in the Spring of 2014 to revamp the Miami Beach Studio. But....</li>
          <li> A few days before she left for Miami, she met her now Fiance David...</li>
        </ul>
